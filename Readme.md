# MPR 
A custom build of PrimeHack-Ishiiruka based on Dolphin Emulator, which focuses on modding and remastering Metroid Prime (trademark of Nintendo).

### Installing

You can download and install MPR like any other version of Dolphn. Download the latest release, unzip MPR into a new folder, and (optionally) add a `portable` `txt` file to isolate your settings and guarantee you're using our defaults.

### Obtaining ROMs.

MPR is not designed to work with anything other than *your own legal* dump of the game. 

You can follow one of these guides to dump your game:
 - (Wii) https://wii.guide/
 - (Wii U) https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/vwii-modding
